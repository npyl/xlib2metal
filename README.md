#  xlib2metal

It couldn't be more straightforward than it is: A bridge between Xlib and Metal for macOS.

## Why?

About a year ago I began porting [conky to macOS](https://github.com/Conky-for-macOS/conky-for-macOS).  Not long after, did I realise that Apple
has really quit supporting and maintaining X11 for macOS.  The negligeance can be seen
in the project's [bureporter site](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&component=New%20Bugs&order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cbug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&product=XQuartz&query_format=advanced).

The only thing that Apple has cared (partially) about is organising the bugreports.

This is not just for conky; this is for [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), for [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) and other important software.
